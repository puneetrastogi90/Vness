# ImageMacro


minimum supported Android version is 21.

Have added a third party library project which is inspired by https://github.com/burhanrashid52/PhotoEditor

The library can easily be changed to other options by simply adding one new file that implements MyImageEditor Interface.



Usage:

1. Tapping on the paint icon changes the background color.

2. Pinch with two fingers to change the size of image or text.

3. Before sharing, downloading the file is mandatory.

4. Undo option is available on the top right corner.

5. There are two format supported for the generated file (JPEG and PNG)
